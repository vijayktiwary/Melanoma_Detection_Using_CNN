## General Information
-To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
Goal:
Develop CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 

#Steps
 1. Importing and understanding Data
 2. Data Preparation and Visualization 
 3. Building Model 1
 4. Fine Tuning -Building Model 2
 5. Fine Tuning - Building Model 3
 6. Conclusion

## Conclusions
1) The Model was overfitted initially
2) Added Drop Out to see if model improves  and overcomes Overfitment problem
3) Removed class imbalance problem using Data augmentation 




## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 
- Tensorflow & Keras
- glob
